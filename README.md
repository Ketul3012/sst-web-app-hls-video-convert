# HLS Video SST Application

## Overview

This project is a serverless application designed to manage video uploads, convert videos to HLS format, and serve them to users. It leverages various AWS services to create a scalable, secure, and efficient cloud architecture.

## AWS Cloud Architecture

### 1. Amazon S3 (Storage)
- **Purpose**: Used for storing uploaded videos, HLS video files after processing, and for deploying the frontend application.
- **Details**: 
  - Uploaded videos are stored in an S3 bucket.
  - After processing, HLS video files are stored in a separate S3 bucket.
  - The frontend application is deployed and served from an S3 bucket configured for static website hosting.

### 2. Amazon DynamoDB (Database)
- **Purpose**: Stores metadata and details about the videos.
- **Details**: 
  - DynamoDB tables store information such as video titles, descriptions, statuses, and S3 locations of the original and processed videos.

### 3. AWS Lambda (Compute)
- **Purpose**: Hosts the backend logic, handling video processing, data manipulation, and other application functionalities.
- **Details**: 
  - Individual Lambda functions are used to process events like video uploads, conversion triggers, and database updates.

### 4. Amazon API Gateway (Networking and Content Delivery)
- **Purpose**: Exposes the Lambda functions as RESTful API endpoints.
- **Details**: 
  - The API Gateway acts as a front door to the application, routing requests to the appropriate Lambda functions and ensuring secure, managed access to backend logic.

### 5. AWS CloudFormation (Management and Governance)
- **Purpose**: Automates the provisioning and management of AWS infrastructure.
- **Details**: 
  - CloudFormation templates are used to define the application's resources, making it easy to deploy and manage the entire stack.

### 6. AWS Elemental MediaConvert (Media Services)
- **Purpose**: Converts uploaded video files into HLS format for adaptive streaming.
- **Details**: 
  - MediaConvert jobs are triggered by Lambda functions to process uploaded videos and convert them into HLS format, storing the output in the designated S3 bucket.

### 7. AWS CloudFront (Networking and Content Delivery)
- **Purpose**: Delivers the frontend application and videos through a global content delivery network (CDN).
- **Details**: 
  - CloudFront is used to serve the frontend application with low latency and high transfer speeds.
  - It also distributes HLS video files globally for optimal viewing performance.

### 8. AWS IAM (Security, Identity, and Compliance)
- **Purpose**: Manages access control and permissions across the application.
- **Details**: 
  - IAM roles and policies are created and assigned to different AWS services, ensuring secure access and operations within the architecture.

### 9. AWS Systems Manager (Management and Governance)
- **Purpose**: Stores and manages configuration variables required by other AWS services.
- **Details**: 
  - Systems Manager Parameter Store is used to securely store and retrieve configuration settings, such as database table names and API keys.

### 10. Amazon CloudWatch (Monitoring and Logging)
- **Purpose**: Monitors and logs actions and usage across the application.
- **Details**: 
  - CloudWatch is used to log API Gateway requests and Lambda function executions, providing insights into application performance and issues.

## Deployment

The application is deployed using AWS CloudFormation and the Serverless Stack (SST) framework. Follow the steps below to deploy the application:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up your AWS credentials and ensure you have the necessary permissions.
3. Install the required dependencies using `pnpm install`.
4. Deploy the infrastructure using the SST framework: `pnpm deploy:sst`.
5. The CloudFormation stack will automatically create and configure all the required AWS resources.

## Configuration

Before deployment, ensure you have set up the necessary configuration variables in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. These include:

- S3 bucket names for video storage.
- DynamoDB table names.
- API keys and secrets for integrated services.
- MediaConvert job templates and settings.

## Usage

After deployment, you can use the provided API endpoints to:

- Upload videos to S3.
- Trigger video processing and conversion to HLS format.
- Retrieve video details from DynamoDB.
- Access and stream videos via the CloudFront-distributed URLs.

## Monitoring and Logging

Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the applicationâ€™s performance and log any issues. Logs for API Gateway requests and Lambda function executions can be found in the CloudWatch console.

## Security

- IAM roles and policies are strictly defined to limit access to only the necessary services and resources.
- S3 buckets are configured with appropriate permissions and encryption to ensure data security.
